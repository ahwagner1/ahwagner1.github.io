Welcome to my blog. Heres a little info about me and what I do:

I am mainly interested in low level programming. I am fascinated by compilers and operating systems, as well as complex
embedded projects.

I am **NOT** an expert at anything I write about. I'm just a guy who likes learning, and I think the best way to do that
is to just dive in a build projects. 

I write about projects I am working on and I do this for two reasons:
1. It helps me truly understand the problem I am working on.
2. I want others to be able to see my reasonings for doing certain things.

I want to learn, and putting "pen to paper" so to say is a fantastic way to ensure that you understand the problem
completely. If I'm not able to clearly explain my reasonings, then I don't understand the topic well enough and need
to study more.

I also want to collaborate with others. I think learning from others is incredibly rewarding.
Constructive criticism is entirely welcome.

### Quartz
Quartz is a systems programming language I am building. It is transpiled instead of compiled and will be used eventually
to build larger projects.
